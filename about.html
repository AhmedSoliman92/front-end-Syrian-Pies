            The fatayer is one of the staples of Middle Eastern cuisine, found as far afield as Iraq, Egypt, Jordan and
            Palestine.
            In Lebanon, they are made in triangles, large or small, with the pastry encasing the filling. Next door, in
            Syria, they are small and shaped like boats, with the pastry folded over only part of the filling to let
            some of it show in the middle.
            Fatayers are a quintessential street food in both countries, sold from bakeries that make them throughout
            the morning; they are also served in restaurants as part of a mezze spread. Possibly they come into their
            own during the Ramadan iftar, when they are eagerly consumed at the breaking of the fast.</p>
        <p>Home cooks in Lebanon and Syria also make trays of them, although many will only preÂ­pare the filling at
            home. This is then taken to the neighbourhood baker, who encases it in his own dough and bakes it to
            complete the fatayer.
            Indeed, the dough is just as important as the filling. Lebanese fatayer are made with an unleavened dough
            enriched with olive oil, while the dough for Syrian fatayer is leavened and made slightly sweet with milk.
            Fillings can include eggs, dairy produce (cheese or labneh) and green herbs and vegetables (spinach,
            purslane, Swiss chard and fresh thyme - the long-leaved one used in salads or pickles).
            The recipe below offers two different styles of filling for Lebanese fatayer, as well as two sizes of
            triangles. Note that while the larger triangles will be quicker to assemble, the presentation will not be as
            dainty as for the smaller versions.
